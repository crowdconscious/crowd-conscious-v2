# Real Signup Issue Debug

## What We Know

1. Email confirmation is ALREADY DISABLED in Supabase ✓
2. Resend mailing system is working ✓
3. You deleted test accounts from Supabase
4. Now you can't sign up with that email again
5. Error: "No API key found in request"
6. URL shows: `ottixfzdytnzxquzrrcf.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup?redirect_to=...`

## The REAL Problem

When you deleted the user from Supabase Authentication dashboard, you likely:

- Deleted from `auth.users` ✓
- BUT the profile still exists in `profiles` table ❌

When trying to signup again:

1. Supabase creates new auth.users entry
2. Trigger tries to create profile
3. Profile already exists → UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ERROR
4. Signup appears to fail

## The ACTUAL Fix

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check if your email exists in profiles
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'francisco.blockstrand@gmail.com';

-- 2. If it exists, DELETE IT
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE email = 'francisco.blockstrand@gmail.com';

-- 3. Also check auth.users (should be empty if you deleted it)
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'francisco.blockstrand@gmail.com';

-- 4. If somehow still there, this will show the user_id
-- Then you can delete properly using:
-- DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'francisco.blockstrand@gmail.com';
```

## Why the Supabase URL appeared

The redirect to `ottixfzdytnzxquzrrcf.supabase.co` happens during the OAuth flow, even with email confirmation disabled. This is NORMAL and expected behavior.

The "No API key" error is a red herring - it's actually showing a different error that happened BEFORE the redirect.

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL above to delete orphaned profile
2. Try signup again
3. Should work!
