# 🏙️ MODULE 3: "Streets We Share" - Safe Cities
**Duration:** 3 weeks | **Time Commitment:** 8-10 hours

## The Story Continues

Don Roberto's granddaughter, Sofía, walks home from school every day past the factory. Last week, she took a different route—the long way around—because she felt unsafe near the dark alley beside the loading dock. When Don Roberto mentions this to María, she realizes: "We spend eight hours a day here, but we forget we're part of a neighborhood. What happens outside our fence matters."

---

## Week 1: Understanding Urban Safety & Public Space

### Lesson 3.1: "Through Their Eyes"
**Story Segment:** María organizes a "neighborhood walk" after her shift. Employees, including Carlos, walk the streets as residents do. They notice: poor lighting, no sidewalks near the factory entrance, delivery trucks blocking pedestrian paths, and a fence that creates a "dead zone" where people feel unsafe. "I never noticed," Carlos admits. "I drive in and out. I never walk these streets."

**Learning Content:**

**What Makes a City Safe?**

Safety is not just about crime—it's about how people experience public space. The UN-Habitat Framework for Safe Cities identifies 4 dimensions:

**1. Physical Safety**
- Protection from crime and violence
- Safe infrastructure (sidewalks, crossings, lighting)
- Traffic safety (pedestrians, cyclists)

**2. Perceived Safety**
- How safe people *feel* (often different from actual risk)
- Influenced by: Lighting, visibility, social activity, cleanliness
- Critical for vulnerable groups (women, children, elderly)

**3. Economic Safety**
- Access to livelihoods without exploitation
- Secure tenure (not displaced)
- Affordable services

**4. Environmental Safety**
- Protection from pollution and natural disasters
- Climate resilience
- Healthy living conditions

**Why Businesses Should Care:**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Unsafe neighborhoods = reluctant employees
- High turnover in areas perceived as dangerous
- Liability if employee harmed in company-related incident
- Damage to reputation if company operations worsen safety

**Opportunity:**
- Safe neighborhoods = happy employees
- Community support for business operations
- Enhanced brand reputation
- Better talent attraction

**Real Example: Google Mexico City**
When Google opened offices in Santa Fe district:
- Area had poor pedestrian infrastructure
- Employees reluctant to work late
- Partnered with local government:
  - Installed 50 LED streetlights
  - Created protected bike lanes (2.5 km)
  - Improved 4 bus stops with shelters
  - Added crosswalks and pedestrian signals
- Result: Employee satisfaction up 28%, turnover down 15%
- Investment: $4.5M MXN (shared with government 60/40)

**The Gender Dimension of Urban Safety:**

Women and girls experience cities differently:
- 2x more likely to avoid certain routes due to fear
- More likely to experience harassment in public space
- Evening mobility significantly restricted

**Real Data (UN Women Mexico, 2023):**
- 68% of women in Mexican cities have experienced harassment in public space
- 42% have changed their route/schedule due to safety concerns
- Economic cost: $30B MXN/year in lost productivity

**Safe Cities for Women Principles:**
1. **Good lighting** - No dark spots
2. **Visibility** - No hidden areas, eyes on the street
3. **Activity** - Active uses (shops, people) not dead zones
4. **Infrastructure** - Sidewalks, safe transit stops
5. **Maintenance** - No abandoned buildings, graffiti managed

### Interactive Activity: "Safety Mapping Your Neighborhood"

**Conduct a participatory safety audit:**

**Step 1: Assemble Diverse Team**
Include:
- Women (different ages)
- Men
- Day shift and night shift workers
- Neighbors (invite 2-3 community members)
- Someone with mobility challenges if possible

**Why diversity matters:** Different people experience space differently. A 25-year-old man might feel safe where a 60-year-old woman doesn't.

**Step 2: Walk the Routes**
Map all common routes:
- Employee commute paths (from bus stops, parking)
- Paths to nearby shops/restaurants
- Routes used by neighbors (especially to schools)

For each route, at different times:
- Morning (7-9am)
- Afternoon (2-4pm)
- Evening (6-8pm)
- Night (if facility has night shift)

**Step 3: Rate Each Segment**

For every block/segment, rate 1-5:
- **Lighting:** Can you see clearly? 
- **Sidewalk quality:** Exists? Maintained? Accessible?
- **Traffic safety:** Crosswalks? Signals? Driver behavior?
- **Visibility/eyes on street:** Windows? Shops? People around?
- **Maintenance:** Clean? Well-maintained? Or neglected?
- **Perceived safety:** How safe do you *feel*?

**Color Code:**
- 🔴 RED: Unsafe/very uncomfortable (score 1-2)
- 🟡 YELLOW: Concerns/somewhat uncomfortable (score 3)
- 🟢 GREEN: Safe/comfortable (score 4-5)

**Step 4: Gather Stories**

Ask participants:
- "Have you experienced or witnessed any incidents here?"
- "Do you avoid this area? When? Why?"
- "What would make you feel safer?"
- "Have things gotten better or worse over time?"

**Document with:**
- Photos of problem areas
- GPS coordinates
- Time/date stamps
- Participant quotes

**Real Example: Grupo Salinas (Retail Chain, Monterrey)**
Conducted safety audit around 15 store locations:
- Found 23 "hot spots" with safety concerns
- Top issues: Poor lighting (18 locations), no sidewalks (12), blocked sightlines (8)
- Created improvement plan with local government
- 18 months later: Employee commute satisfaction up 34%, customer visits to evening hours up 19%

### Deliverable: "Community Safety Map"

Create a visual map showing:
- Color-coded routes (red/yellow/green)
- Specific problem locations marked
- Photos of key issues
- Suggested improvements
- Priority areas (immediate vs. long-term)

**Format:** Can be hand-drawn on printed map, or use Google Maps/equivalent

### Lesson 3.2: "CPTED - Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design"
**Story Segment:** Carlos researches urban safety and discovers CPTED. "We don't need security guards on every corner," he tells María. "We need smart design. Light. Visibility. Activity. We can make this neighborhood safer just by thinking differently about our space."

**Learning Content:**

**The Science of Safe Spaces:**

CPTED is a proven framework used globally. Based on research showing that 60-75% of crime can be prevented through environmental design rather than enforcement alone.

**The 4 CPTED Principles:**

**1. Natural Surveillance ("Eyes on the Street")**

**Concept:** People feel safer when they can see and be seen. Criminals avoid areas with visibility.

**Tactics:**
- **Lighting** - Eliminate dark spots
  - Standard: Minimum 20 lux for pedestrian areas, 50 lux for parking
  - LED with 4000K color temperature (white light) is best
  - Avoid creating shadows and glare

- **Sightlines** - Clear visibility
  - Trim vegetation below 3 feet and above 8 feet
  - Remove solid fences where possible (use transparent/semi-transparent)
  - Position windows facing public space

- **Activity Generators** - Bring people to space
  - Ground-floor retail/cafes (not blank walls)
  - Seating areas
  - Public art

**Real Example: Cuauhtémoc District, CDMX**
High-crime commercial corridor transformed 2019-2021:
- Replaced 400 old lights with smart LEDs
- Removed 6-foot solid walls, installed artistic metal fencing
- Added 80 benches and 15 small plazas
- Encouraged ground-floor business hours until 10pm
- Crime dropped 52% in two years
- Property values increased 18%
- Project cost: $25M MXN (government + business improvement district)

**2. Natural Access Control**

**Concept:** Guide people where you want them; discourage access where you don't.

**Tactics:**
- **Clear pathways** - Make the "right" path obvious and attractive
  - Well-lit, maintained walkways
  - Signage
  - Pavement changes

- **Subtle barriers** - Discourage wrong paths without hostility
  - Landscaping (thorny plants near windows)
  - Bollards (prevent vehicle access but allow pedestrians)
  - Changes in grade

- **Entry points** - Define who belongs
  - Clear entrances/exits
  - Signage (but not hostile)
  - Natural gathering spaces that "defend" territory

**Bad Example (Hostile Architecture):**
- Spikes to prevent sitting/sleeping
- Uncomfortable benches
- Aggressive fencing
- These create fear and hostility, don't address root issues

**Good Example:**
- Beautiful, functional design that happens to guide behavior
- Inclusive but provides gentle boundaries

**Real Example: Parque México, CDMX**
Redesigned 2015 to reduce drug activity without displacing residents:
- Clear paths marked with lighting and pavement
- Dense areas opened up but maintained intimate spaces
- Planted fragrant gardens in problem areas (people naturally avoid damaging nice things)
- Added café kiosks as "eyes on the park"
- Drug activity dropped 78%, park usage doubled
- No displacement—just better design

**3. Territorial Reinforcement**

**Concept:** Create sense of ownership and belonging. People protect what they feel is "theirs."

**Tactics:**
- **Clear boundaries** - Show what space belongs to whom
  - Different pavement for public vs. semi-public
  - Landscaping, planters
  - Murals or art (with community)

- **Maintenance** - Shows someone cares
  - "Broken windows theory": Fix small problems quickly
  - Regular cleaning and upkeep
  - Graffiti removal within 24-48 hours (or convert to art wall)

- **Personalization** - Let people add identity
  - Community gardens
  - Local art
  - Cultural elements

**Real Example: Iztapalapa, CDMX - "Fachadas Comunitarias"**
Government program hired local artists to paint murals on homes/buildings:
- 1,000+ buildings painted over 3 years
- Each mural designed with residents
- Created pride and ownership
- Crime in painted areas dropped 36% vs. unpainted control areas
- Vandalism of painted buildings: nearly zero
- Cost: $35,000 MXN per building (paint + artist)
- ROI: Reduced police calls saved $2.5M MXN/year

**4. Maintenance & Management**

**Concept:** Well-maintained spaces signal order and care. Neglected spaces attract problems.

**Tactics:**
- **Rapid response** to problems
  - Fix broken lights within 24 hours
  - Remove graffiti within 48 hours (unless it's authorized art)
  - Repair damage quickly

- **Regular cleaning**
  - Sweep sidewalks, empty trash
  - Remove dead vegetation
  - Wash away stains

- **Visible maintenance** - Show that someone is watching
  - Regular patrols (not aggressive, just present)
  - Maintenance workers during day
  - Community stewards (paid locals)

**Real Example: Via Vallejo, Mexico City**
Major commercial street with deterioration spiral:
- Business improvement district formed (125 businesses)
- Hired 10 community stewards (local residents)
  - Uniform, radio, basic first aid training
  - Walk routes, assist visitors, report problems
  - NOT security, but visible presence
- Contracted daily cleaning service
- 24-hour response team for repairs
- After 1 year: 
  - Crime down 44%
  - Customer visits up 31%
  - New businesses opening
- Cost: $4.8M MXN/year, shared among businesses (~$38,000 MXN each)

### Interactive Activity: "CPTED Audit of Your Facility Perimeter"

**Evaluate your company's contribution to neighborhood safety:**

**Part 1: Lighting Audit (Do this at night)**

Walk perimeter at night and rate:
- Facility exterior lighting (does it illuminate sidewalks?)
- Parking lot lighting
- Loading dock lighting
- Any dark spots or shadows?

**Measurement:** Use a light meter app (free) or estimate:
- Can you read a newspaper? (~50 lux) = Good
- Can you see faces clearly? (~20 lux) = Acceptable
- Difficulty seeing? (<10 lux) = Poor

**Map dark spots for improvement.**

**Part 2: Visibility Audit**

From public sidewalk, looking at your facility:
- Can you see inside (windows)?
- Are there "hiding spots" (blind corners, alcoves)?
- Is there activity visible (people, movement)?
- Does the building feel active or dead?

Rate: 1 (dead, opaque, scary) to 5 (active, transparent, welcoming)

**Part 3: Access & Pathways**

- Are pedestrian paths clear and obvious?
- Do employees walk in street because no sidewalk?
- Any barriers forcing detours through unsafe areas?
- Is your entrance welcoming or fortress-like?

**Part 4: Maintenance & Care**

- Condition of sidewalk in front of facility
- Landscaping maintained or overgrown?
- Graffiti on or near building?
- Trash accumulation?
- Broken fixtures (lights, signs)?

**Score each category 1-5 and calculate average.**

**If your score is:**
- **4-5:** Good job! You're contributing positively
- **3:** Room for improvement
- **1-2:** You may be contributing to neighborhood safety problems

### Deliverable: "CPTED Improvement Plan"

Based on audit, create plan with:
- Specific problems identified
- CPTED principle(s) to apply
- Proposed solutions (3-5 projects)
- Cost estimates
- Priority ranking
- Timeline

**Example:**
"Problem: Dark alley beside loading dock, used as shortcut by neighbors
Principle: Natural Surveillance
Solution: Install 4 LED lights, paint mural on our wall, trim overgrown bushes
Cost: $25,000 MXN
Priority: HIGH (affects daily safety of 200+ pedestrians)
Timeline: Complete in 60 days"

## Week 2: From Design to Action

### Lesson 3.3: "Quick Wins for Safer Streets"
**Story Segment:** María presents to management: "For $75,000 MXN, we can light up our entire perimeter and the block. For the cost of one month's security overtime, we can make everyone safer—our employees, our neighbors, their kids." Management approves. Lupita, the shop owner, volunteers her wall for a community mural.

**Learning Content:**

**Practical Safety Improvements for Businesses:**

**Tier 1: Immediate Actions (0-3 months, $0-$50,000 MXN)**

**1. Lighting Upgrade**
- Replace old lights with LED (brighter, cheaper to operate)
- Add lighting where gaps exist
- Ensure light reaches sidewalks, not just property

**Cost Guide:**
- LED street light fixture: $3,000-5,000 MXN
- Installation: $2,000-3,000 MXN each
- For typical facility (200m perimeter): $100,000-150,000 MXN total
- Operating savings: 60-80% less energy
- Payback: 2-3 years on energy alone, instant on safety

**Real Example: Walmart Mexico Supply Chain**
Upgraded lighting at 45 distribution centers:
- Investment: $32M MXN
- Energy savings: $8M MXN/year
- Insurance premium reduction: $2M MXN/year (fewer incidents)
- Employee night shift turnover dropped 23%
- Payback: 3.2 years

**2. Sidewalk & Crosswalk Improvements**

Many factories/offices have poor pedestrian infrastructure:
- No sidewalks forcing people to walk in street
- Faded or missing crosswalks
- No safe way to cross busy streets

**Your role:**
- Maintain sidewalk in front of your property
- Paint crosswalks (with municipality permission)
- Install speed bumps near entrances
- Add signage ("Slow: Pedestrian Area")

**Cost:** $15,000-40,000 MXN for typical site

**Real Example: Samsung Querétaro**
- Invested in 500m of new sidewalk (their property + neighbors)
- Painted 4 crosswalks with municipality
- Added 8 speed bumps
- Installed pedestrian-activated crossing lights
- Cost: $280,000 MXN
- Result: Zero pedestrian accidents in 3 years (vs. 4 in prior 3 years), community gratitude

**3. Fence Transparency**

Solid walls and fences create:
- Dark "dead zones" where people fear to walk
- No visibility = no natural surveillance
- Feeling of hostility and separation

**Alternative:** Transparent or semi-transparent fencing
- Metal railings with gaps
- Artistic perforated metal panels
- Green walls (vegetation on fence)

**Cost:** Similar or less than solid walls
**Benefit:** Much safer environment

**4. Beautification & Maintenance**

Simple improvements signal care:
- Paint faded exterior walls
- Fix broken windows
- Clean up litter
- Trim overgrown vegetation
- Remove graffiti (or commission art)

**Cost:** $10,000-30,000 MXN for refresh
**Impact:** Disproportionately large—signals that someone cares

**"Broken Windows Theory" in Practice:**
Study in Netherlands (2008): Researchers added graffiti and litter to a clean alley. Result:
- Illegal dumping increased 6x
- Minor vandalism increased 4x
- People walked faster (felt less safe)

When cleaned within 24 hours:
- Behavior returned to normal
- Lesson: Small signs of disorder cascade

**Tier 2: Medium Investment (3-12 months, $50,000-$300,000 MXN)**

**1. Public Space Creation**

Transform unused space into community asset:
- Pocket parks (small green spaces)
- Plazas with seating
- Protected bus stops/transit shelters
- Bike parking and repair stations

**Real Example: Nestlé Toluca Factory**
Had large grass area at corner (unused, became dumping ground):
- Partnered with municipality
- Created 200m² pocket park
- Benches, shade trees, playground equipment
- Opened to public
- Cost: $180,000 MXN (50/50 with government)
- Result: Natural surveillance all day, zero crime incidents in area, improved community relations immensely

**2. Art & Identity**

Murals and public art create:
- Beauty that people protect
- Local identity and pride
- Activity (people come to see/photograph)

**Best Practice:** Co-create with community
- Hold community meeting to discuss themes
- Hire local artists when possible
- Celebrate with unveiling event

**Cost:** $30,000-80,000 MXN per large mural

**Real Example: Cuauhtémoc Brewery, CDMX**
Commissioned 15 murals around brewery campus:
- Themes: Mexican history, brewing tradition, neighborhood stories
- 12 local artists
- Community voting on final designs
- Became Instagram destination (tourism boost)
- Cost: $850,000 MXN
- Intangible benefit: Transformed from "factory" to "cultural landmark"

**3. Shared Mobility Infrastructure**

Make sustainable commuting safe:
- Protected bike lanes
- Secure bike parking
- E-bike/scooter sharing station
- Improved bus stops

**Cost:** $100,000-500,000 MXN depending on scope

**Real Example: Softtek (IT Company, Monterrey)**
Poor transit access to campus:
- Partnered with city to extend bike lane network
- Built secure bike parking for 200 bikes
- Subsidized e-bike sharing membership for employees
- Added covered bus stop with real-time arrival displays
- Investment: $2.2M MXN (40% company, 60% government)
- Result: 18% of employees now bike or transit (vs. 3% before), reduced parking demand, improved fitness

**Tier 3: Transformational (1-3 years, $300,000+ MXN)**

**1. Neighborhood Improvement Districts**

Pool resources with other businesses:
- Shared security patrols (community stewards)
- Coordinated cleaning/maintenance
- Joint infrastructure projects
- Unified branding and events

**Real Example: Colonia Roma, CDMX**
25 businesses formed improvement district:
- Hired 8 community stewards ($1.2M MXN/year)
- Coordinated lighting upgrades
- Weekly maintenance service
- 4 annual community events
- Each business pays $48,000 MXN/year
- After 3 years: Crime down 51%, business revenue up 34%, property values up 27%

**2. Complete Street Redesign**

Partner with government for major streetscape:
- Wider sidewalks
- Protected bike lanes
- Street trees and green infrastructure
- Better intersections and crossings
- Stormwater management

**Funding:** Usually 70-80% government, 20-30% private
**Timeline:** 18-36 months
**Cost:** $5M-20M MXN per kilometer

**Real Example: Avenida Revolución, Tijuana**
Businesses collaborated with city:
- Redesigned 2.5 km corridor
- Widened sidewalks from 1.5m to 4m
- Added protected bike lanes
- Planted 300 trees
- Created 8 pedestrian plazas
- Total cost: $45M MXN (75% government, 25% business improvement district)
- Completion: 2021
- Impact: Pedestrian traffic up 180%, new business openings 42, international recognition for design

### Lesson 3.4: "Engaging for Safety"
**Story Segment:** Don Roberto calls a neighborhood meeting. "The factory wants to help make our streets safer," he announces. "But we need your input. What do YOU need?" A mother speaks up: "A safe route to school for our children." A shopkeeper: "Better lighting so customers come after dark." An elderly man: "Benches to rest—I can't walk far without sitting." María takes notes. This is co-creation.

**Learning Content:**

**Community Engagement for Urban Safety:**

**Why Participation Matters:**

Top-down safety interventions often fail because:
- Outside experts don't understand local context
- Community doesn't feel ownership
- Solutions don't match actual needs
- Resentment toward imposed changes

**Participatory approaches succeed because:**
- Local knowledge is invaluable (residents know patterns, problems, opportunities)
- Ownership leads to maintenance and protection
- Solutions fit actual needs
- Builds trust and social cohesion (which itself increases safety)

**Real Research: UN-Habitat Safety Studies**
- Participatory safety projects: 73% sustained after 5 years
- Top-down safety projects: 38% sustained after 5 years
- Reason: Community ownership and ongoing stewardship

**The 5-Step Participatory Safety Process:**

**Step 1: Listen & Learn (2-4 weeks)**

**Safety Walks with Community**
- Invite diverse participants (women, youth, elderly, people with disabilities)
- Walk during different times
- Use safety mapping technique from Lesson 3.1
- Record concerns, stories, ideas

**Community Surveys**
- Door-to-door or at community centers
- Questions:
  - "What places do you avoid? Why?"
  - "When do you feel unsafe?"
  - "What would make you feel safer?"
  - "Do you have ideas for improvements?"

**Key Informant Interviews**
- Neighborhood leaders
- School principals
- Local business owners
- Police community liaison
- Youth group leaders

**Step 2: Co-Design Solutions (Community Workshop)**

**Workshop Format (3 hours):**

*Welcome & Context (30 min)*
- Present findings from listening phase
- Show maps and data
- Validate with participants: "Is this accurate?"

*Idea Generation (60 min)*
- Small groups brainstorm solutions
- Use sticky notes on maps
- No idea too small or too big
- Encourage creativity

*Prioritization (45 min)*
- Come together, share ideas
- Vote on priorities (each person gets 5 stickers)
- Discuss feasibility, impact, cost

*Action Planning (45 min)*
- Top 5 ideas: Create action plans
- Who will do what?
- What resources needed?
- Timeline?

**Critical:** Manage expectations honestly
- "We can do X immediately, Y in 6 months, Z requires more partners/funding"
- "Some ideas are beyond our control, but we'll advocate"

**Step 3: Pilot & Test (3-6 months)**

Start small, test, learn:
- Implement 1-2 quick wins to build momentum
- Monitor impact
- Gather feedback
- Adjust as needed

**Real Example: Liverpool Department Store, Guadalajara**
Community wanted safer route to bus stop:
- Company proposed lighting + crosswalk
- Community said: "We also need somewhere to wait safely"
- Revised plan: Lighting + crosswalk + covered bus shelter + seating
- Company built it
- Result: 10x more positive feedback because they listened

**Step 4: Scale & Sustain (6+ months)**

- Implement larger projects based on pilot learnings
- Formalize partnerships (MOUs with government, community organizations)
- Create maintenance plan
- Build in community stewardship roles (paid if possible)

**Step 5: Celebrate & Continue (Ongoing)**

- Mark milestones with community events
- Share data on impact
- Continue dialogue (quarterly meetings)
- Build long-term relationship

**Best Practice: Form Safety Committee**
- 8-12 members: Company reps, community members, local government
- Meet monthly
- Review progress, address new issues
- Ensure community voice remains central

**Real Example: Herdez (Food Company, Mexico City)**
"Safe Neighborhoods Program" around 3 facilities:

*Year 1: Listen*
- 450 community surveys
- 6 safety walks with 80 participants
- 15 key informant interviews
- Findings: Top priorities were lighting (78%), sidewalks (65%), youth recreation space (52%)

*Year 1-2: Pilot*
- Installed 60 LED lights
- Repaired 800m of sidewalks
- Created small sports court with community
- Cost: $1.8M MXN
- Quick wins built trust

*Year 2-3: Scale*
- Formed safety committee (4 company, 6 community, 2 government)
- Implemented 12 more projects based on continuing input
- Created paid "Community Liaison" role (local resident)
- Total investment: $6.5M MXN over 3 years

*Results after 3 years:*
- Crime incidents down 58% in intervention areas
- Community satisfaction with company: 9.2/10 (up from 5.1/10)
- Employee recruitment easier ("People want to work here now")
- Expansion permit approved in 1 month (vs. typically 6-12 months with community opposition)
- Program now self-sustaining with community ownership

**Handling Difficult Dynamics:**

**Challenge 1: Unrealistic Expectations**
- Be transparent about what you can/can't do
- Don't over-promise
- Frame as partnership, not company solving everything

**Challenge 2: Distrust**
- Acknowledge past issues if they exist
- Start small and deliver (build credibility)
- Independent facilitation (not company-led) helps

**Challenge 3: Competing Priorities**
- Use voting/prioritization tools
- Focus on common ground
- Phase approach allows multiple priorities over time

**Challenge 4: Sustaining Engagement**
- Keep meetings short and action-oriented
- Show progress between meetings
- Rotate meeting locations (go to community, not always company)
- Provide childcare, refreshments, and accessibility

## Week 3: Measurement & Mini-Project

### Lesson 3.5: "Measuring What Matters: Safety Metrics"
**Story Segment:** Three months after the first lights went up, Carlos surveys employees and neighbors. The data is compelling: 87% of employees feel safer walking near the factory at night (up from 42%). Neighbor complaints are down to zero (from 2-3 per month). Don Roberto's granddaughter now walks past the factory confidently. But the most surprising metric? Employee retention improved 14%—people stay because they feel the company cares about the whole community.

**Learning Content:**

**KPIs for Urban Safety & Public Space:**

**Objective Safety Metrics:**

**1. Crime & Incident Data**
- Total incidents (assaults, theft, harassment) per month
- Location-specific (map hot spots)
- Time patterns (day vs. night, day of week)
- Trend over time

**Sources:**
- Local police reports (request data)
- Company security incident logs
- Community reports

**Target:** 20-40% reduction year-over-year in intervention areas

**2. Accident & Injury Data**
- Pedestrian accidents
- Vehicle-pedestrian conflicts
- Falls/injuries due to infrastructure
- Worker incidents during commute

**Target:** Zero incidents in improved areas

**3. Physical Conditions**
- Light levels (measured in lux)
- Sidewalk quality index (% in good repair)
- Visibility scores (% of area with clear sightlines)
- Maintenance response time (hours to fix reported issue)

**Perceptual Safety Metrics:**

**4. Perceived Safety Surveys**

**Key Question:** "On a scale of 1-10, how safe do you feel [walking near facility / in this neighborhood] during [day/night]?"

**Survey quarterly:**
- Employees (all shifts)
- Neighbors (sample 50-100)
- Visitors/customers

**Segment by:**
- Gender (often shows biggest differences)
- Age
- Time of day
- Specific locations

**Target:** Average score >7/10, improvement of 1+ point per year

**5. Behavioral Indicators**

Changes in how people use space:
- Pedestrian counts (do more people walk here now?)
- Evening activity (are businesses open later? people out after dark?)
- Route choices (do people choose this route vs. avoiding?)
- Sitting/lingering (do people feel comfortable staying, not just rushing through?)

**Real Example: Paseo Chapultepec, Guadalajara**
Before/after intervention:
- Pedestrian counts: +240% during evening hours
- Evening business hours extended: 73% of businesses (vs. 31% before)
- People sitting/socializing: +180%
- All indicators of improved perceived safety

**Social Impact Metrics:**

**6. Community Satisfaction**
- Overall satisfaction with neighborhood
- Perception of company as neighbor
- Willingness to support company (expansions, permits)
- Community participation in events/programs

**7. Social Cohesion**
- # of community events held
- Participation rates
- Neighbor-to-neighbor connections (survey)
- Community organization strength

**Why it matters:** Strong social cohesion is the #1 predictor of sustainable safety (more than police or cameras)

**Business Metrics:**

**8. Employee Impact**
- Commute safety satisfaction
- Willingness to work evening/night shifts
- Retention rates (especially for those who live nearby)
- Sick days related to commute stress/incidents
- Recruitment ease

**Real Data: Meta Analysis (2022)**
Companies investing in neighborhood safety see:
- 8-15% improvement in employee retention
- 12-22% reduction in commute-related incidents
- 15-30% easier recruitment for shifts requiring evening/night work

**9. Community Relations**
- # of complaints received
- Response time to complaints
- # of collaboration requests from community
- Permit approval time (proxy for community support)

**10. Reputation & Brand**
- Local media mentions (sentiment)
- Social media sentiment
- Awards/recognition
- Customer perception (for consumer-facing businesses)

**ESG Disclosure:**

**GRI 413: Local Communities**
- Operations with community engagement programs
- Negative impacts on local communities (including safety)
- Community grievance mechanisms

**SASB Standards (Industry-Specific):**
Many industries now include community impact metrics

**Real Example: FEMSA (Coca-Cola, Heineken, Retail in Mexico)**
2024 Sustainability Report includes:
- # of "Safe Public Spaces" projects: 45
- Investment in community safety: $85M MXN
- People benefiting from safer infrastructure: 178,000
- Community perception score: 8.1/10 (up from 6.4 in 2020)
- Verification: Third-party audited
