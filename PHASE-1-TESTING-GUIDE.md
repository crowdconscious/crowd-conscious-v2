## üìã Overview

This guide will help you test all the corporate features we just built.

---

## üéØ Step 1: Make Yourself a Corporate Admin

### **Option A: Use SQL (Fastest for Testing)**

1. **Check your current status:**

   ```sql
   -- Open: CHECK-MY-CORPORATE-STATUS.sql
   -- Replace 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com' with your actual email
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

2. **Convert to corporate admin:**

   ```sql
   -- Open: MAKE-ME-CORPORATE-ADMIN.sql
   -- Replace 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com' with your actual email (appears twice)
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

3. **Sign out and sign back in** to refresh your session

### **Option B: Use Corporate Signup Form (Testing Full Flow)**

1. Go to: `https://crowdconscious.app/signup-corporate`
2. Fill out the corporate signup form with test data
3. Use a **different email** than your main account
4. Complete signup and test as a new corporate user

## üöÄ Step 2: Access Corporate Dashboard

### **After running SQL or signing up:**

1. Go to: `https://crowdconscious.app/corporate/dashboard`
2. You should see:
   - Company overview
   - Employee management section
   - Program modules
   - Impact metrics (empty for now)

### **If you're redirected to `/dashboard` instead:**

**Troubleshooting:**

```sql
-- Run this to verify your profile was updated:
SELECT
  email,
  is_corporate_user,
  corporate_role,
  corporate_account_id
FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';

-- Should show:
-- is_corporate_user: true
-- corporate_role: 'admin'
-- corporate_account_id: (some UUID)
```

**If still not working:**

1. Clear browser cache
2. Sign out completely
3. Sign back in
4. The auth callback should redirect you to `/corporate/dashboard`

---

## üë• Step 3: Test Employee Invitations

### **From Corporate Dashboard:**

1. Navigate to **"Employees"** tab
2. Fill in the invitation form:
   - **Email:** Use your test email or a real email you can access
   - **Full Name:** Test Employee
   - **Modules:** Select one or more modules
3. Click **"Send Invitation"**

### **Expected Results:**

‚úÖ Success message appears  
‚úÖ Employee appears in "Pending Invitations" list

### **Check the Email:**

üìß Subject: `Invitaci√≥n a Concientizaciones`  
üìß From: Crowd Conscious  
üìß Contains: Company name, invitation link

---

## üìß Step 4: Test Employee Acceptance Flow

### **From the invitation email:**

1. Click the **"Aceptar Invitaci√≥n"** button
2. You should see: `https://crowdconscious.app/employee-portal/accept-invitation?token=...`

### **On the acceptance page:**

1. Email should be pre-filled (read-only)
2. Fill in:
   - Full Name
   - Password (min 6 characters)
   - Confirm Password
3. Click **"Crear Mi Cuenta"**

### **Expected Results:**

‚úÖ Success message: "¬°Cuenta Creada! üéâ"  
‚úÖ Auto-redirect to `/login` after 2 seconds  
‚úÖ New profile created with `corporate_role = 'employee'`

---

## üîê Step 5: Test Smart Login Redirects

2. Sign in with your admin email
3. **Should redirect to:** `/corporate/dashboard`

### **Test as Corporate Employee:**

## üé® Step 6: Test Dashboard Integration

### **From the Main App Dashboard:**

1. Sign in as a **corporate admin**
2. Go to: `https://crowdconscious.app/dashboard`
3. You should see a **purple/teal banner** at the top:
   - Shows your company name
   - Has a button: **"Ver Dashboard ‚Üí"**
4. Click the button ‚Üí should take you to `/corporate/dashboard`

### **As a Corporate Employee:**

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### **Issue: Can't access corporate dashboard**

**Solution:**

```sql
-- Verify your profile has the correct flags:
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';

-- If is_corporate_user is false or corporate_account_id is null:
-- Run MAKE-ME-CORPORATE-ADMIN.sql again
```

### **Issue: Invitation email not received**

**Check:**

1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables
2. Check Resend dashboard for email logs
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Verify email address is correct

**Debug:**

```bash
# Check server logs in Vercel for email sending errors
# Look for: "Assessment quote email sent to: ..."
```

### **Issue: Token invalid or expired**

**Tokens expire after 7 days.**

**Solution:**

```sql
-- Re-send invitation (delete old one first):
DELETE FROM employee_invitations WHERE email = 'employee@example.com';

-- Then send a new invitation from the corporate dashboard
```

### **Issue: Employee can't access employee portal**

**Verify:**

```sql
SELECT
  email,
  is_corporate_user,
  corporate_role,
  corporate_account_id
FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'employee@example.com';

-- Should show:
-- is_corporate_user: true
-- corporate_role: 'employee'
-- corporate_account_id: (should match admin's corporate_account_id)
```
