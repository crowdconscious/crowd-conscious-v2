## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe (Required for payments)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Resend (Required for emails)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key

# Admin Setup
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

### **Step 2: Database Setup**

Run these SQL migrations in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- 1. First run the Stripe payment setup
-- File: sql-migrations/stripe-payment-functions.sql

-- 2. Then run the admin setup (UPDATE THE EMAIL!)
-- File: sql-migrations/setup-admin-user.sql
-- IMPORTANT: Change 'your_email@example.com' to your actual email
```

### **Step 3: Stripe Configuration**

1. **Create Stripe Account**: Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. **Get API Keys**: Dashboard → Developers → API Keys
3. **Set Up Webhook**:
   - Endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. **Copy webhook secret** to environment variables

### **Step 4: Resend Configuration**

1. **Create Resend Account**: Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. **Get API Key**: Dashboard → API Keys
3. **Update sender domain** in `lib/resend.ts` (line 8)
4. **Verify your domain** in Resend dashboard

### **Step 5: Admin Access**

1. **Update your email** in `sql-migrations/setup-admin-user.sql`
2. **Run the SQL** in Supabase
3. **Access admin dashboard** at `/admin`

## 🔥 **How It All Works Together**

### **Brand Sponsorship Flow:**

```
1. Brand discovers needs → /brand/discover
2. Brand applies to sponsor → Creates sponsorship record
3. Community approves → Admin gets notified
4. Admin approves → Brand gets email with payment link
5. Brand pays → Stripe processes with 15% fee
6. Community gets funds → Impact tracking begins
```

### **Email Notifications:**

- **Welcome**: Sent on user/brand registration
- **Approval**: Sent when sponsorship is approved
- **Monthly Reports**: Automated impact summaries
- **Admin Alerts**: For moderation needs

### **Admin Moderation:**

- **Dashboard**: `/admin` (admin-only access)
- **Community Review**: Approve/reject new communities
- **Sponsorship Review**: Moderate high-value sponsorships
- **User Management**: Suspend problematic users
- **Analytics**: Platform health and revenue tracking

## 💰 **Revenue Model**

### **Platform Fee Structure:**

- **15% fee** on all sponsorship payments
- Automatically calculated and collected via Stripe
- **Example**: $1000 sponsorship = $150 platform fee + $850 to community

### **Fee Breakdown Display:**

```
Sponsorship Amount: $1,000.00
Platform Fee (15%): -$150.00
Community Receives: $850.00
```
