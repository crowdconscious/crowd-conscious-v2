# Concientizaciones - Corporate Training Portal Strategy

## 🎯 Product Vision

### Integration Points

#### 1. **Shared Authentication**

- Use existing Supabase Auth
- Add `is_corporate_user` boolean to profiles table
- Add `corporate_account_id` to profiles table

#### 2. **Profile Bridge**

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN is_corporate_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN corporate_account_id UUID REFERENCES corporate_accounts(id);
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN training_xp INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN corporate_role TEXT; -- 'admin', 'hr', 'employee'
```

#### 3. **Community Creation API**

```typescript
// POST /api/corporate/graduate-to-community
{
  corporate_account_id: uuid,
  certification_id: uuid
}

// Creates:
// 1. Community in main app
// 2. Migrates employees as founding members
// 3. Transfers XP and achievements
// 4. Loads sponsorship credits
// 5. Links corporate_account to community
```

## 💡 Key Differentiators

## 📚 Resources & References

### Inspiration:

- Duolingo (gamified learning)
- Coursera (structured courses)
- B Corp Certification (impact standards)
- LinkedIn Learning (corporate training)

### ESG Standards:

- UN Sustainable Development Goals
- GRI Standards (Global Reporting Initiative)
- ISO 26000 (Social Responsibility)
- Mexican NOM standards

### Competitive Landscape:

- Traditional consultancies (expensive, theoretical)
- Online ESG courses (generic, no action)
- B Corp certification (expensive, lengthy)
- **Our advantage:** Action-oriented + affordable + community integration

---

## 🎬 Final Thoughts

This is more than a training program. It's a **transformation engine** that:

- Generates predictable B2B revenue
- Feeds your B2C community platform
- Creates measurable impact
- Builds lasting neighborhoods change

The two-portal system is your moat. Once companies invest in training and see results, they're sticky. Once employees are certified and in communities, they're engaged.

**This could be a $40M MXN business by Year 3.**

Let's build it. 🚀
