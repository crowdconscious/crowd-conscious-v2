# Concientizaciones - Corporate Training Portal Strategy

## üéØ Product Vision

**Concientizaciones** is a corporate training program that transforms employees into sustainability champions who actively improve their communities. Unlike traditional consulting, we provide story-driven education that leads to measurable action.

### The Core Insight

Companies want ESG compliance and employee engagement. Communities want real change. Employees want meaningful work. We connect all three through our two-portal system:

1. **concientizaciones.crowdconscious.app** - Corporate training portal (B2B)
2. **crowdconscious.app** - Community action platform (B2C)

**The Bridge:** Trained employees graduate into active community members, turning corporate spending into lasting neighborhood impact.
