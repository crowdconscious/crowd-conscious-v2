## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Treasury tab not appearing**
- **Cause:** JavaScript/React error
- **Fix:** Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: "Treasury not found" error**
- **Cause:** Migration not run
- **Fix:** Run migration 045
- **Verify:** Check `community_treasury` table exists

### **Issue: Pool checkbox not showing**
- **Cause:** User is not admin or no balance
- **Fix:** Verify user role is 'admin' or 'moderator'
- **Check:** Pool balance > 0

### **Issue: Donation webhook not processing**
- **Cause:** Webhook configuration
- **Fix:** Verify webhook URL and secret
- **Check:** Stripe webhook logs

### **Issue: "Insufficient funds" when using pool**
