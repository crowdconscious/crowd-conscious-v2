# 🔥 CASCADE DELETION FIX - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## 🚨 The Error You're Seeing

```
Failed to delete community: update or delete on table "communities" 
violates foreign key constraint "community_members_community_id_fkey" 
on table "community_members"
```

## 🎯 What This Means

The database has records in `community_members` that reference the community. 
Without `ON DELETE CASCADE`, the database refuses to delete the community to 
maintain data integrity.

## ✅ THE FIX (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
Go to: https://app.supabase.com → Your Project → SQL Editor

### Step 2: Run the CASCADE Fix
1. Open the file: `sql-migrations/fix-cascade-deletions.sql`
2. **Copy ALL ~295 lines**
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**
5. Wait for "Success" message (takes ~5 seconds)

### Step 3: Verify It Worked
Run this query to check CASCADE is enabled:

```sql
SELECT
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    rc.delete_rule
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints AS rc
    ON tc.constraint_name = rc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
AND tc.table_name = 'community_members'
ORDER BY tc.table_name;
```

Look for `delete_rule` = `CASCADE` ✅

### Step 4: Test Deletion Again
1. Go back to your admin dashboard
2. Try deleting the community again
3. **Should now work!** ✅

## 🔍 What CASCADE Does

### Before (Your Current Situation):
```
Delete community → ❌ ERROR
  └─ Has community_members → Foreign key blocks deletion
```

### After (With CASCADE):
```
Delete community → ✅ SUCCESS
  └─ Automatically deletes:
      ├─ All community_members
      ├─ All community_content
      ├─ All votes
      ├─ All comments
      ├─ All sponsorships
      ├─ All impact_metrics
      └─ All related records
```

## 📋 What Gets Deleted When You Delete a Community

When you delete a community, CASCADE automatically deletes:

1. **All members** (`community_members`)
2. **All content** (`community_content`) - needs, events, polls, challenges
3. **All votes** on that community's content
4. **All comments** on that community's content
5. **All sponsorships** for that community's content
6. **All impact metrics** for that community
7. **All share links** for that community's content
8. **All event registrations** for that community's events
9. **All poll votes** for that community's polls
10. **All notifications** related to that community

**This is the expected and correct behavior!**

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### 1. Deletions Are Permanent
Once deleted with CASCADE, all related data is gone. 
Make sure you're deleting the right community!

### 2. Test on a Test Community First
Before deleting real communities, try deleting "Test Community 1" 
or create a dummy community to test.

### 3. Why This Wasn't in the Original Schema
The original `database-schema.sql` file didn't include `ON DELETE CASCADE` 
on the foreign keys. This is a common oversight and we're fixing it now.

---

## 🎯 TL;DR - Do This Now:

```sql
-- 1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor

-- 2. Copy and run entire fix-cascade-deletions.sql file

-- 3. Try deleting community again - will work!
```

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

If you still get errors after running the migration:

### Check 1: Verify CASCADE was applied
```sql
SELECT constraint_name, delete_rule 
FROM information_schema.referential_constraints 
WHERE constraint_name LIKE '%community_members%';
```
Should show `delete_rule` = `CASCADE`

### Check 2: Check for other constraint errors
Look at the exact error message - it might be a different table.

### Check 3: Restart Supabase connection
Sometimes Supabase needs to refresh its schema cache.
Wait 30 seconds and try again.

## 💡 For Future Tables

When creating new tables with foreign keys, ALWAYS add CASCADE:

```sql
-- ❌ BAD (what we had)
FOREIGN KEY (community_id) REFERENCES communities(id)

-- ✅ GOOD (what we need)
FOREIGN KEY (community_id) REFERENCES communities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

---

**Bottom Line**: Run `fix-cascade-deletions.sql` in Supabase and community deletions will work! 🚀
