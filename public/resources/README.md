# Module Resources

This directory contains downloadable resources for training modules.

## Current Resources

### Module 1: Aire Limpio
- **Inventario de Emisiones Template** (Coming soon)
  - Excel template for tracking organizational emissions
  - Will be available at: `/resources/inventario-emisiones-template.xlsx`

### Module 2-6: Coming Soon
- Resources for other modules will be added as they are developed

## How to Add Resources

1. Place files in this directory (`public/resources/`)
2. Reference them in lesson content using: `/resources/filename.ext`
3. Update resource links in module_lessons table

## Temporary Workaround

Until resource files are created, links will return 404. This doesn't break the lessons - it just means the downloadable templates aren't available yet. Users can still complete all activities using the interactive tools built into the platform.
