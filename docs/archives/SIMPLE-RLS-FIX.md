# üéØ SIMPLE RLS FIX

## **THE PROBLEM**

You have **restrictive policies** that require community membership:

- `"Community members can register for events"` ‚ùå
- `"Community members can vote on polls"` ‚ùå
- `"Community members can create comments"` ‚ùå

## **THE SOLUTION**

Run this **simple SQL fix** in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Remove the restrictive policies
DROP POLICY "Community members can register for events" ON public.event_registrations;
DROP POLICY "Community members can vote on polls" ON public.poll_votes;
DROP POLICY "Community members can create comments" ON public.comments;

-- Add permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can register for events" ON public.event_registrations
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can vote on polls" ON public.poll_votes
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Comments already has a good policy: "Users can create comments"
```

## **VERIFICATION**

After running the fix, check the policies:

```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('event_registrations', 'poll_votes', 'comments')
AND cmd = 'INSERT'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected result:**

- `event_registrations`: `"Anyone can register for events"` with simple `auth.uid() = user_id`
- `poll_votes`: `"Anyone can vote on polls"` with simple `auth.uid() = user_id`
- `comments`: `"Users can create comments"` with simple `auth.uid() = user_id`

## **TEST IMMEDIATELY**

1. ‚úÖ Register for any event (should work for any authenticated user)
2. ‚úÖ Vote on any poll (should work for any authenticated user)
3. ‚úÖ Comment on any content (should work for any authenticated user)
