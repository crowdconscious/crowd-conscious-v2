## 🎯 What's Next (Remaining 5%)

### **Pool-Funded Sponsorships** (High Priority)

**What It Is:**
Allow community admins to sponsor needs using the community pool instead of personal payment.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. **Update `SponsorshipCheckout.tsx`:**

   ```typescript
   // Add new state
   const [usePoolFunds, setUsePoolFunds] = useState(false)
   const [poolBalance, setPoolBalance] = useState(0)

   // Fetch pool balance if admin
   useEffect(() => {
     if (isAdmin) {
       fetchPoolBalance()
     }
   }, [])

   // Add checkbox in UI (only for admins)
   {isAdmin && poolBalance > 0 && (
     <div>
       <input
         type="checkbox"
         checked={usePoolFunds}
         onChange={(e) => setUsePoolFunds(e.target.checked)}
       />
       <label>Use Community Pool Funds (Balance: ${poolBalance})</label>
     </div>
   )}

   // Modify submission logic
   if (usePoolFunds) {
     // Call API to spend from treasury
     await fetch('/api/treasury/spend', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify({
         communityId,
         contentId,
         amount,
         sponsorshipId
       })
     })
   } else {
     // Normal Stripe checkout
   }
   ```

2. **Create `/api/treasury/spend` endpoint:**
   - Check admin permissions
   - Verify sufficient balance
   - Call `spend_from_treasury()` SQL function
   - Create sponsorship record
   - Update content funding
   - Send notification email

3. **Update sponsorships table:**
   - Add `funded_by_treasury` boolean column
   - Track which sponsorships came from pool

4. **Add Email Notifications:**
   - Notify community members when pool is used
   - Show transparency of spending

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### **Email Enhancements** (Medium Priority)

**Needed Emails:**

1. **Donation Confirmation**
   - "Thank you for donating $X to [Community] Pool!"
   - Show new balance
   - Encourage others to donate

2. **Sponsorship from Pool**
   - "Your community sponsored [Need]!"
   - Show remaining balance
   - Highlight collective impact

3. **Monthly Treasury Report**
   - Total donations this month
   - Total spent this month
   - Top contributors
   - Impact achieved

**Implementation:**

- Add templates to `lib/resend.ts`
- Call from webhooks and API routes
- Use existing email infrastructure

---

## 📊 System Architecture

### **Payment Flow Options:**

#### **Option A: Individual Sponsorship (Existing)**

```
User → Stripe Checkout → 85% to Creator + 15% Platform Fee
```

#### **Option B: Treasury Donation (New)**

```
Member → Stripe Checkout → 100% to Community Pool
```

#### **Option C: Pool Sponsorship (Coming Next)**

```
Admin → Check Balance → Deduct from Pool → Sponsor Need
```

### **Data Flow:**

```
User Action
    ↓
Frontend Component (CommunityTreasury or SponsorshipCheckout)
    ↓
API Route (/api/treasury/*)
    ↓
SQL Function (add_treasury_donation or spend_from_treasury)
    ↓
Database Update (community_treasury + treasury_transactions)
    ↓
Webhook (for Stripe payments only)
    ↓
Email Notification
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **✅ Implemented:**

- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Authentication required for all actions
- Admin-only spending controls
- Balance integrity checks
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)

### **Best Practices:**

- Never expose service role key to client
- Always validate user permissions
- Log all treasury transactions
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Audit trail in database

## 💡 Usage Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Small Community Fundraiser**

1. Community wants to sponsor a local cleanup event
2. Members donate to pool: $50 + $100 + $75 = $225
3. Admin sponsors cleanup event using $200 from pool
4. Community celebrates collective impact
5. Remaining $25 stays for future use

### **Scenario 2: Large Community Initiative**

1. Community pool has $5,000 from many small donations
2. Major community need arises (disaster relief)
3. Admin sponsors $3,000 from pool immediately
4. No single member had to pay large amount
5. Demonstrates power of collective action

### **Scenario 3: Ongoing Support**

1. Community builds pool over time
2. Regularly sponsors small community needs
3. Creates sustainable support system
4. Members feel ownership and pride
5. Attracts more members and donations

## 🎓 For New Developers

### **Understanding the Treasury System:**

**Key Concept:** The treasury is a **virtual pool** of funds:

- Not a separate Stripe account
- Platform holds the funds
- Database tracks the balance
- SQL functions ensure integrity

**Why It Works:**

- Simple for users (just donate)
- Transparent tracking
- Secure with RLS
- Flexible spending options
- Scales to any community size

**How to Debug:**

1. Check database: `community_treasury` table
2. View transactions: `treasury_transactions` table
3. Test SQL functions directly in Supabase
4. Monitor webhook logs in Stripe
5. Check API route logs in Vercel
