# ðŸŽ¯ Platform Simplification Strategy - Remove Brand User Type

## Overview

Remove the confusing "brand user type" while maintaining full sponsorship capabilities. Anyone can sponsor as individual or business.

---

## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Database Changes (SQL)

### Phase 2: Remove Brand UI Components

### Phase 3: Update Sponsorship Flow

### Phase 4: Create Trusted Brands Display

### Phase 5: Testing & Cleanup

---

## PHASE 1: DATABASE CHANGES

### Step 1.1: Update Sponsorships Table

```sql
-- Add sponsor type and business details to sponsorships
ALTER TABLE sponsorships
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sponsor_type TEXT DEFAULT 'individual' CHECK (sponsor_type IN ('individual', 'business')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS brand_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS brand_logo_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS brand_website TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tax_id TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS display_name TEXT, -- What to show publicly
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sponsor_email TEXT, -- For receipt
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sponsor_phone TEXT; -- For receipt

-- Add index for brand queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sponsorships_brand_name ON sponsorships(brand_name) WHERE sponsor_type = 'business';
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sponsorships_status_type ON sponsorships(status, sponsor_type);
```

### Step 1.2: Simplify Profiles Table

```sql
-- Keep user_type for now (for admin), but simplify
-- Remove brand-specific fields that are now in sponsorships
ALTER TABLE profiles
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS company_name,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS company_description,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS company_website,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS company_size,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS industry,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS logo_url,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS verified_brand,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS total_sponsored,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS sponsorship_count;

-- Keep user_type simple: 'user' or 'admin' only
ALTER TABLE profiles
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_user_type_check,
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_user_type_check
  CHECK (user_type IN ('user', 'admin'));
```

### Step 1.3: Remove Brand Tables (Optional - keep for historical data)

```sql
-- Option A: Keep tables for historical data but mark as deprecated
COMMENT ON TABLE brand_preferences IS 'DEPRECATED - Brand functionality moved to sponsorships table';
COMMENT ON TABLE brand_community_relationships IS 'DEPRECATED - Tracked through sponsorships now';
COMMENT ON TABLE sponsorship_applications IS 'DEPRECATED - Direct sponsorship flow only';

-- Option B: Drop tables entirely (only if no important data)
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS brand_preferences CASCADE;
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS brand_community_relationships CASCADE;
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sponsorship_applications CASCADE;
```

### Step 1.4: Create View for Trusted Brands

```sql
-- Create materialized view for trusted brands (auto-updates)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS trusted_brands AS
SELECT DISTINCT
  brand_name,
  brand_logo_url,
  brand_website,
  COUNT(*) as sponsorship_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_sponsored,
  MIN(created_at) as first_sponsorship,
  MAX(created_at) as last_sponsorship
FROM sponsorships
WHERE
  sponsor_type = 'business'
  AND status = 'paid'
  AND brand_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand_name, brand_logo_url, brand_website
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1  -- At least 1 paid sponsorship
ORDER BY total_sponsored DESC;

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_trusted_brands_name ON trusted_brands(brand_name);

-- Refresh function (call this after new sponsorships)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_trusted_brands()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW trusted_brands;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Auto-refresh trigger when sponsorships are paid
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trigger_refresh_trusted_brands()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'paid' AND OLD.status != 'paid' AND NEW.sponsor_type = 'business' THEN
    PERFORM refresh_trusted_brands();
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_refresh_trusted_brands ON sponsorships;
CREATE TRIGGER trg_refresh_trusted_brands
  AFTER UPDATE ON sponsorships
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_refresh_trusted_brands();
```

---

## PHASE 2: REMOVE BRAND UI COMPONENTS

### Files to Delete:

```
app/(app)/brand/                           # Entire directory
app/components/BrandModeToggle.tsx        # If exists
```

### Files to Modify:

#### 1. HeaderClient.tsx

```typescript
// REMOVE:
- User/Brand toggle buttons
- Brand-specific navigation
- Brand dashboard link

// KEEP:
- User dashboard
- Communities
- Discover
- Admin (if admin)
```

#### 2. Navigation.tsx

```typescript
// REMOVE:
- Brand portal links
- Brand discover links

// KEEP:
- Standard navigation
```

#### 3. Layout files

```typescript
// REMOVE:
- Brand-specific routes
- Brand redirects
```

---

## PHASE 3: UPDATE SPONSORSHIP FLOW

### New Sponsorship Component Structure:

```typescript
// components/SponsorshipCheckout.tsx
interface SponsorshipFormData {
  amount: number;
  sponsor_type: "individual" | "business";

  // Individual fields
  display_name?: string;

  // Business fields (shown when sponsor_type === 'business')
  brand_name?: string;
  brand_logo?: File;
  brand_website?: string;
  tax_id?: string;

  // Contact info
  email: string;
  phone?: string;

  // Message
  message?: string;
  anonymous: boolean;
}
```

### Checkout Flow:

1. Select amount
2. Choose sponsor type (radio buttons)
3. Conditional fields based on type
4. Payment with Stripe
5. Confirmation with receipt

---

## PHASE 4: TRUSTED BRANDS DISPLAY

### Landing Page Section:

```typescript
// components/TrustedBrands.tsx
- Query trusted_brands view
- Display brand logos in grid
- Link to brand website
- Show sponsorship count
- Auto-updates as new brands sponsor
```

### Community Page:

```typescript
// components/CommunitySponsor.tsx
- Show sponsors of community content
- Display business logos
- Display individual names
- Link to sponsor website if available
```

---

## PHASE 5: TESTING & CLEANUP

### Test Checklist:

- [ ] Sponsorship as individual works
- [ ] Sponsorship as business works
- [ ] Brand logo upload works
- [ ] Trusted brands appear on landing
- [ ] Old brand users can still use app
- [ ] No broken links to brand portal
- [ ] All sponsorships display correctly
