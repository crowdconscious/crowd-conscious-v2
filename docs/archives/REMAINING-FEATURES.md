## üí¨ **QUESTIONS FOR USER**

1. **Certificates Priority:**
   - Should we build employee certificates first, or corporate certificates?
   - What design style? (Formal, modern, playful?)
   - What social platforms to prioritize? (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook?)

2. **Impact Metrics:**
   - What specific metrics are most important?
   - Should we create an "Impact Score" or "Sustainability Score"?
   - Gamification: levels, badges, leaderboards?

3. **Corporate Reports:**
   - How detailed should response viewing be?
   - Export format preference? (CSV, Excel, PDF?)
   - Should there be analytics/charts?

4. **Community Articles:**
   - Is this a must-have for Phase 2?
   - Or can it wait until marketplace is fully built?

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S WORKING WELL**

- Progress tracking (unique lessons)
- Tool modals (all 8 tools)
- Evidence uploader (with save button)
- Marketplace browse page
- Module detail page
- Module builder interface
- Database schema (Phase 2 ready)
- Mobile optimization
- Smart routing
- Course content (Clean Air module)

---

## üöÄ **RECOMMENDATION**

**START WITH CERTIFICATES** because:
1. High user value (tangible achievement)
2. Shareable (organic marketing)
3. Professional (builds trust)
4. Relatively quick to implement
5. Visual impact (good for demos/sales)

Then move to **Employee Dashboard completion** to provide full experience.

Then tackle **Corporate Reports** to show ROI to paying customers.
