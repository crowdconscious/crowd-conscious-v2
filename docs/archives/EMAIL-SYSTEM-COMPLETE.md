## How It Works

### Vercel Cron Jobs

The platform uses Vercel's built-in cron job system (no external services needed!):

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/monthly-impact",
      "schedule": "0 9 1 * *" // 1st of month at 9 AM
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/challenge-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 8 * * *" // Every day at 8 AM
    }
  ]
}
```

### Security

- All cron endpoints are protected with `CRON_SECRET` authorization
- Only Vercel can trigger the jobs automatically
- Manual testing requires the secret

### Real Data

- All emails pull real-time data from the database
- Personalized for each user
- Calculated metrics (XP, achievements, impact)

## Setup Required

### In Vercel Dashboard:

**1. Add Environment Variables**

Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables** and add:

| Variable              | Value                        | Environments |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://crowdconscious.app` | All          |
| `CRON_SECRET`         | Generate random string\*     | All          |

\*Generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32` or use any secure random string generator

**2. Redeploy**

After adding variables:

- Go to **Deployments**
- Click **â€¢â€¢â€¢** on latest deployment
- Click **Redeploy**

## Testing

### Test Monthly Impact Email (Manual)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
  https://crowdconscious.app/api/cron/monthly-impact
```

### Test Challenge Reminders (Manual)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \

```

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sent": 15,
  "failed": 0,
  "results": [...]
}
```

## Email Schedule

| Email Type          | Frequency | Time    | Day |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------- | --- |
| Signup Welcome      | Instant   | -       | -   |
