# 🧪 **Content Creation Test Guide**

## ✅ **Current Status**

### **Issues Fixed:**

1. ✅ **API Route Parameters**: Fixed `params.id` to `await params` for Next.js 15 compatibility
2. ✅ **Content Form**: Removed MediaUpload dependency and image upload for now
3. ✅ **TypeScript Errors**: Added type assertions to fix compilation issues
4. ✅ **UI Components**: Added inline components to make form functional

### **Known Issues:**

- ⚠️ **Storage RLS**: Storage buckets have RLS policy violations
- ⚠️ **Image Upload**: Currently disabled (shows preview only)
- ⚠️ **Landing Page**: Has dynamic import errors (doesn't affect content creation)

## 🚀 **How to Test Content Creation**

### **Step 1: Login to the App**

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with your Supabase account
3. Go to `/communities` (should show existing communities)

### **Step 2: Test Content Creation**

1. Click on a community to enter it
2. Look for "Create Content" button or manually go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/communities/{community-id}/content/new
   ```
3. Select content type (Need, Event, Poll, Challenge)
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Description**
   - **Type-specific fields** based on selection
   - **Image upload** (optional - preview only for now)

### **Step 3: Expected Behavior**

- ✅ Form should load without errors
- ✅ All field types should be editable
- ✅ Image preview should work (but not save)
- ✅ Submit should create content in database
- ✅ Should redirect back to community page
- ✅ Content should appear in community content list

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Form Doesn't Submit:**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check terminal for server errors
3. Verify you're logged in and a community member

### **If Image Upload Fails:**

- **Expected**: Image upload is disabled for now
- **Workaround**: Content saves without images
- **Solution**: Skip image for testing content creation

### **If Access Denied:**

- Ensure you're a member of the community
- Check that the community ID in URL is correct
- Try with a different community

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now**

### ✅ **All Content Types:**

- **Need**: Title, description, funding goal, deadline, activities
- **Event**: Title, description, date, time, location, max participants
- **Poll**: Title, description, multiple options (add/remove)
- **Challenge**: Title, description, expected impact

### ✅ **Database Operations:**

- Content record creation in `community_content` table
- Poll options creation for polls
- Need activities creation for needs
- Proper foreign key relationships

### ✅ **Form Validation:**

- Required fields marked and validated
- Dynamic field visibility based on content type
- Add/remove functionality for polls and activities
