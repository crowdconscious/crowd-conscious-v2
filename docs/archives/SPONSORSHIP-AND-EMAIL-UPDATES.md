# Sponsorship System & Email Triggers - Complete Update

## üéØ Overview

This update completely overhauls the sponsorship system and implements comprehensive email triggers throughout the app to keep users engaged and informed.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Unified Support Options** 

The sponsorship form now offers **three types of support** instead of just financial:

- **üí∞ Financial Support** - Monetary contributions (existing functionality)
- **üôã Volunteer Time** - Offer skills and time
- **üì¶ Provide Resources** - Donate materials or equipment

**Changed Files:**
- `app/components/SponsorshipCheckout.tsx` - Complete redesign with support type selector
- `sql-migrations/044-update-sponsorships-support-types.sql` - Database schema update

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic form that shows relevant fields based on support type
- Financial: Shows amount selector, sponsor tiers, business fields, Stripe checkout
- Volunteer: Shows skills textarea, no payment required
- Resources: Shows resource description textarea, no payment required
- Submit button text changes based on support type

---

### 2. **Removed Approval Requirement**

Sponsorships now go **directly to "approved" status** instead of requiring community approval.

**Why:** Simplifies the flow for early testing and removes friction for users wanting to help.

**Changed:**
- `app/components/SponsorshipCheckout.tsx` - Line 177: `status: 'approved'` (was `'pending'`)

**Impact:**
- Non-financial support (volunteer/resources) completes immediately
- Financial support still requires Stripe payment completion
- No waiting for community admin approval

---

### 3. **Email Confirmation System**

#### **New API Routes Created:**

##### A. Support Confirmation Emails
**File:** `app/api/support/confirm-email/route.ts`

Sends immediate confirmation emails for all sponsorship/support types:
- **Financial:** Confirmation with amount, next steps for payment
- **Volunteer:** Thank you with skills summary, explains next steps
- **Resources:** Thank you with resource description, coordination details

**Triggered by:** `SponsorshipCheckout.tsx` after successful submission (line 211-230)

##### B. External Response Confirmation Emails
**File:** `app/api/external-response/confirm-email/route.ts`

Sends confirmation emails for non-logged-in users who interact:
- **Poll Votes:** Vote recorded, encourages signup
- **Event RSVPs:** Event details, date/time/location, encourages signup  
- **Need Support:** Thank you for offering support, encourages signup

**Triggered by:**
- `app/(public)/share/[token]/PublicPollForm.tsx` (lines 108-126)
- `app/(public)/share/[token]/PublicEventRSVP.tsx` (lines 115-133)
- `app/(public)/share/[token]/PublicNeedSupport.tsx` (lines 66-83)

---

### 4. **Automated Email Systems** (Cron Jobs)

#### A. Monthly Impact Report
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already implemented
**File:** `app/api/cron/monthly-impact/route.ts`
**Email Template:** `lib/resend.ts` - `monthlyImpactReport()`

**Sends:**
- User's level and XP
- Communities joined
- Content created
- Events attended  
- Votes cast
- New achievements
- Environmental impact metrics
- Call to action to return

**Schedule:** Monthly (requires Vercel cron setup)

#### B. Event Reminders (24h Before)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Newly created
**File:** `app/api/cron/event-reminders/route.ts`

**Sends:**
- Event details (date, time, location)
- Event description
- Link to view event
- Works for both:
  - Authenticated users (registered via `event_registrations`)
  - Non-logged-in users (RSVP'd via `external_responses`)

**Schedule:** Daily (checks for events happening tomorrow)

#### C. Challenge Reminders
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already implemented  
**File:** `app/api/cron/challenge-reminders/route.ts`

**Sends reminders for challenges ending in next 7 days**

---

### 5. **Event Registration Emails**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already working
**File:** `app/api/events/[id]/register/route.ts` (lines 116-169)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

**File:** `sql-migrations/044-update-sponsorships-support-types.sql`

**Added columns to `sponsorships` table:**
```sql
support_type text CHECK (support_type IN ('financial', 'volunteer', 'resources'))
volunteer_skills text
resource_description text
```

**Run this migration in Supabase SQL Editor to enable the new features.**

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Run Database Migration**
```sql
-- Copy and run the contents of:
sql-migrations/044-update-sponsorships-support-types.sql
```

### 2. **Verify Resend Email Configuration**
- Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
- Verify `comunidad@crowdconscious.app` is configured as sender
- Test by visiting `/api/diagnose-email` in production

### 3. **Set Up Cron Jobs in Vercel**

Add to `vercel.json` (if not already present):
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/event-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/monthly-impact",
      "schedule": "0 10 1 * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/challenge-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Set CRON_SECRET Environment Variable**
```bash
# Generate a secure secret
openssl rand -hex 32

# Add to Vercel:
CRON_SECRET=your_generated_secret
```

### 5. **Test the Features**

**Test Support Types:**
1. Go to any "need" content
2. Click "Sponsor This Need"
3. Try each support type:
   - Financial: Should show amount selector and Stripe redirect
   - Volunteer: Should show skills textarea and complete immediately
   - Resources: Should show resource textarea and complete immediately
4. Check email inbox for confirmation

**Test Public Forms:**
1. Share a poll/event/need using the share button
2. Open in incognito/private window (not logged in)
3. Submit vote/RSVP/support offer
4. Check email for confirmation

## üìß Email Templates

All emails include:
- Beautiful gradient headers
- Clear, actionable content

- Volunteer: Blue/Teal gradient  
- Resources: Purple/Teal gradient

---

## üé® UI Improvements

### Sponsorship Form
- **Before:** Only monetary donation option
- **After:** Three clear support type cards to choose from
- Each type shows relevant fields and hides irrelevant ones
- Submit button text changes based on selection
- Color-coded sections for easy visual distinction

### Public Forms
- Added "Check your email for confirmation" to success messages
- Clearer feedback after submission

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Email sending doesn't block user flow**  
   - Wrapped in try-catch
   - Logs errors but doesn't fail the submission
   - User experience is not impacted if email fails

2. **Support type validation**  
   - Database constraint ensures only valid types
   - Frontend validates required fields based on type
   - Stripe only triggered for financial support

3. **Event reminders work for all users**  
   - Queries both `event_registrations` (auth users) 
   - And `external_responses` (non-auth users)
   - Both receive the same quality experience

4. **Cron jobs are protected**  
   - Require `CRON_SECRET` header
   - Return 401 for unauthorized access
   - Suitable for Vercel Cron or external schedulers
