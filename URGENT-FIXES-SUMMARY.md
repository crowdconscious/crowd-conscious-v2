# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIXES SUMMARY

## Issue 1: Sponsorship "message" Column Missing âœ… FIXED

**Error**: `Could not find the 'message' column of 'sponsorships' in the schema cache`

**Fix**: Updated `sql-migrations/simplify-remove-brand-type.sql` to include:

- `message TEXT` column
- `anonymous BOOLEAN` column

**Action Required**:

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the updated migration: `sql-migrations/simplify-remove-brand-type.sql`
3. This will add the missing columns

## Issue 2: Settings Page - Language/Currency Not Persisting

**Problems**:

1. Language selection doesn't actually change app language
2. Currency selection doesn't persist
3. Profile picture upload button doesn't work

**Current Status**:

- Settings ARE being saved to localStorage
- But NOT being applied globally across the app
- Profile picture upload is commented out (TODO)

**What Needs to Be Done**:

### A. Language System (Needs Implementation)

The app currently has NO i18n (internationalization) system. To fix:

1. **Install i18n library**:

```bash
npm install next-intl
```

2. **Create translation files**:

```
/messages
  /en.json
  /es.json
```

3. **Wrap app with i18n provider**
4. **Replace all text with translation keys**

**This is a MAJOR feature** - would take 4-6 hours to implement properly.

### B. Currency Display (Quick Fix Possible)

Currently prices are hardcoded as "MXN". To fix:

1. Create a `useCurrency()` hook that reads from localStorage
2. Create a `<Price>` component that formats based on selected currency
3. Replace all price displays with `<Price amount={value} />`

**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

### C. Profile Picture Upload (Quick Fix)

The upload code exists but is commented out due to type issues.

**Fix**: Uncomment the database update code in `ProfilePictureUpload.tsx`

## Quick Wins You Can Implement Now:

### 1. Run SQL Migration (5 minutes)

```sql
-- Copy entire contents of sql-migrations/simplify-remove-brand-type.sql
-- Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Click RUN
```

### 2. Configure Stripe (10 minutes)

Add to Vercel Environment Variables:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...`

### 3. Test Sponsorship Flow (5 minutes)

- Go to a need
- Click "Sponsor This Need"
- Should now work without "message" column error

---

## Recommendations:

### Short Term (Do Now):

1. âœ… Run SQL migration (fixes sponsorship)
2. âœ… Configure Stripe (enables payments)
3. âœ… Test sponsorship flow

### Medium Term (Next Sprint):

1. Implement currency conversion system
2. Create `<Price>` component for dynamic currency display
3. Fix profile picture upload

### Long Term (Future Feature):

1. Full i18n implementation with next-intl
2. Professional translation service
3. Language-specific content

---

## Current Workarounds:

### For Language:

- Keep English as primary
- Add Spanish translations manually for key pages
- Use simple text replacement for now

### For Currency:

- Default to MXN (you're launching in Mexico)
- Show both currencies: "$5,000 MXN ($250 USD)"
- Add conversion rate API later

### For Profile Picture:

- Users can upload via settings
- Picture shows in header
- Just needs database update uncommented

## Files That Need Attention:

1. **`sql-migrations/simplify-remove-brand-type.sql`** âœ… FIXED
   - Run this in Supabase now

2. **`components/ProfilePictureUpload.tsx`**
   - Lines 77-82: Uncomment database update
   - Lines 153-158: Uncomment database update

3. **`app/(app)/settings/SettingsClient.tsx`**
   - Language/currency save to localStorage âœ…
   - Need global application system

---

## Priority Order:

1. **CRITICAL** (Do Now): Run SQL migration
2. **HIGH** (Do Today): Configure Stripe
3. **MEDIUM** (This Week): Fix profile picture upload
4. **LOW** (Next Sprint): Currency system
5. **FUTURE** (v2.0): Full i18n

---

**Bottom Line**:

- Sponsorship will work after SQL migration âœ…
- Language/Currency are cosmetic (can wait)
- Focus on getting payments working first ðŸ’°
