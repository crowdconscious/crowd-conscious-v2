# üíö Platform Fee Coverage Feature

**Implementation Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ Overview

We've implemented a transparent platform fee option that allows sponsors to optionally cover the 15% platform fee, ensuring 100% of their intended sponsorship amount goes directly to the community creator.

### **The Psychology**

This feature leverages the "psychology of generosity" - when given the option to help more, most people will choose to do so. Similar patterns are used successfully by:
- GoFundMe (tip coverage)
- Kickstarter (processing fee coverage)
- Change.org (contribution coverage)

---

## ‚ú® What's New

### **1. Transparent Fee Breakdown**

Sponsors now see a clear breakdown during checkout:
- **Sponsorship amount**: $1,000 MXN
- **Platform operations (15%)**: $150 MXN
- **Option**: ‚úì Cover platform fee so 100% goes to the community

### **2. Dynamic Total Calculation**

The total adjusts based on the checkbox:
- **‚úÖ Fee Covered**: Total = $1,150 MXN ‚Üí Creator receives $1,000 (100%)
- **‚òê Fee Not Covered**: Total = $1,000 MXN ‚Üí Creator receives $850 (85%)

### **3. Visual Feedback**

- Green heart emoji (üíö) when fee is covered
- Blue heart emoji (üíô) when standard split applies
- Real-time total updates
- Clear messaging about creator's payout

---

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Files Modified**

1. **`app/components/SponsorshipCheckout.tsx`**
   - Added `coverPlatformFee` state (defaults to `true` for psychology)
   - New payment breakdown UI section
   - Checkbox with persuasive messaging
   - Real-time total calculation display
   - Passes `coverPlatformFee` to API

2. **`app/api/create-checkout/route.ts`**
   - Accepts `coverPlatformFee` parameter
   - Calculates three amounts based on checkbox state:
     - `totalChargeAmount`: What sponsor pays
     - `platformFeeAmount`: Platform's cut (always 15% of original)
     - `founderAmount`: What creator receives
   - Stores metadata for tracking and analytics

3. **`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`**
   - Extracts `coverPlatformFee` and `originalSponsorshipAmount` from metadata
   - Enhanced logging to track generous sponsors
   - Special console message when fee is covered

---

## üí∞ Fee Calculation Logic

### **Scenario 1: Sponsor Covers Fee (Default)**

```
Sponsorship Amount: $1,000 MXN
coverPlatformFee: true

Calculations:
- totalChargeAmount = $1,000 √ó 1.15 = $1,150 MXN
- platformFeeAmount = $1,000 √ó 0.15 = $150 MXN
- founderAmount = $1,000 MXN

Result:
- Sponsor pays: $1,150 MXN
- Creator receives: $1,000 MXN (100% of intended sponsorship)
- Platform receives: $150 MXN (13% of total charged)
```

### **Scenario 2: Standard Split**

```
Sponsorship Amount: $1,000 MXN
coverPlatformFee: false

Calculations:
- totalChargeAmount = $1,000 MXN
- platformFeeAmount = $1,000 √ó 0.15 = $150 MXN
- founderAmount = $1,000 - $150 = $850 MXN

Result:
- Sponsor pays: $1,000 MXN
- Creator receives: $850 MXN (85% of sponsorship)
- Platform receives: $150 MXN (15% of total)
```

## üìä Analytics & Tracking

The system tracks fee coverage for future analytics:

### **Metadata Stored in Stripe:**
- `coverPlatformFee`: 'yes' or 'no'
- `originalSponsorshipAmount`: Original amount before fee calculation
- `platformFeeAmount`: Platform's cut
- `founderAmount`: What creator receives

### **Potential Metrics to Track:**
- % of sponsors who cover fees
- Average lift in revenue per sponsorship
- Total additional revenue from fee coverage
- Correlation with sponsorship amounts

---

## üé® UI/UX Features

### **Design Decisions**

1. **Checkbox Defaults to Checked**
   - Psychology: People are more likely to leave it checked than to actively check it
   - Anchoring effect: Sets the expectation that covering fees is the "normal" choice

2. **Positive Framing**
   - "Cover platform fee so 100% goes to the community"
   - Emphasizes the benefit to the creator, not the cost to sponsor
   - Uses checkmark (‚úì) in label for positive reinforcement

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Green color (üíö) when fee is covered = generosity, positivity
   - Blue color (üíô) for standard = neutral, still supportive
   - Real-time updates make the choice feel responsive and important

4. **Transparency**
   - Shows exact amounts at all times
   - No hidden fees or surprises
   - Builds trust with clear breakdown

5. **Not Shown for Pool Funds**
   - Avoids confusion when admins use community treasury
   - Pool funds don't need fee coverage (community is paying itself)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Checkbox not showing**
- **Check:** Is "Use Community Pool Funds" selected? (It hides the fee option)
- **Check:** Is support type set to "Financial Support"?
- **Fix:** Only shows for financial sponsorships paid via Stripe

### **Issue: Total not updating when checkbox changes**
- **Check:** Browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Check:** React state is updating correctly
- **Fix:** Refresh page, clear cache

### **Issue: Creator received wrong amount**
- **Check:** Webhook logs for `coverPlatformFee` value
- **Check:** Stripe payment intent shows correct application fee
- **Check:** Connected account ID is correct
- **Fix:** Verify metadata passed correctly to Stripe

### **Issue: Stripe checkout shows wrong total**
- **Check:** API logs for `totalChargeAmount` calculation
- **Check:** `coverPlatformFee` parameter passed to API
- **Fix:** Ensure frontend sends correct boolean value
