# 🌬️ MODULE 1: "The Awakening" - Clean Air
**Duration:** 3 weeks | **Time Commitment:** 8-10 hours

## The Story Begins

María pulls her daughter's inhaler from her purse—the third time this week. Outside the factory windows, she notices a gray haze settling over the neighborhood. "It wasn't always like this," Don Roberto tells her at the bus stop, between coughs. "Ten years ago, you could see the mountains clearly every morning."

That night, María can't sleep. She thinks about the factory where she's worked for eight years. The machines, the deliveries, the energy that keeps everything running. Could they be part of the problem? Could they also be part of the solution?

## Week 1: Understanding Our Air

### Lesson 1.1: "The Invisible Impact"
**Story Segment:** María downloads an air quality app and is shocked to see her neighborhood rated "Unhealthy." She shows it to Carlos, the new sustainability manager, who admits he never thought to check.

**Learning Content:**

**What is Air Quality?**
Air quality measures the concentration of pollutants that affect human health and the environment. The main indicators are:

- **PM2.5** (Particulate Matter): Tiny particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers that penetrate deep into lungs
  - *Safe level:* Below 12 µg/m³ (WHO standard)
  - *Unhealthy:* Above 35 µg/m³
  - *Real example:* Mexico City averages 25-30 µg/m³, above safe levels

- **PM10**: Larger particles that cause respiratory issues
  - *Safe level:* Below 50 µg/m³
  - *Sources:* Construction dust, industrial processes, unpaved roads

- **CO2** (Carbon Dioxide): Greenhouse gas from combustion
  - *Indoor safe level:* Below 1,000 ppm
  - *Outdoor concentration:* Currently ~420 ppm globally (up from 280 ppm pre-industrial)
  - *Critical threshold:* 1.5°C warming linked to 450 ppm

- **VOCs** (Volatile Organic Compounds): Chemicals that evaporate into air
  - *Common sources:* Paints, solvents, cleaning products, plastics
  - *Health effects:* Headaches, dizziness, liver damage (long-term)

- **NOx & SOx**: Nitrogen and sulfur oxides from fuel combustion
  - *Main source:* Diesel trucks, industrial boilers
  - *Effects:* Acid rain, respiratory disease, smog

**Real-World Example: Grupo Bimbo's Air Quality Initiative**
In 2020, Grupo Bimbo committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030. They:
- Installed air quality monitors in 12 manufacturing plants
- Switched 4,500 delivery vehicles to electric or hybrid
- Reduced PM2.5 emissions by 38% in urban facilities
- Saved $2.8M MXN annually in fuel costs

**ESG Connection:**
Air quality directly impacts:
- **E (Environmental):** Climate change mitigation, ecosystem health
- **S (Social):** Employee health, community relations, public health
- **G (Governance):** Regulatory compliance, risk management

### Interactive Activity: "Your Air Quality Baseline"

**Step 1: Measure Current State**
1. Download air quality app (IQAir, AIRE, or local government app)
2. Record readings for your facility location (3 times/day for 3 days)
3. Record readings for nearby residential areas
4. Map pollution sources within 5km radius

**Step 2: Calculate Your Carbon Footprint (Scope 1 & 2)**

*Scope 1 - Direct Emissions:*
```
Company vehicles: _____ km driven/month × 0.27 kg CO2/km = _____ kg CO2
Natural gas heating: _____ m³/month × 2.0 kg CO2/m³ = _____ kg CO2
Diesel generators: _____ liters/month × 2.68 kg CO2/L = _____ kg CO2
TOTAL SCOPE 1: _____ kg CO2/month
```

*Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions (Electricity):*
```
Electricity use: _____ kWh/month × 0.458 kg CO2/kWh (Mexico grid) = _____ kg CO2
TOTAL SCOPE 2: _____ kg CO2/month
```

**YOUR MONTHLY FOOTPRINT: _____ kg CO2 = _____ tons CO2/year**
