# üö® Critical Fixes Required - Action Plan

## Issues Identified:

1. ‚ùå Comments asking logged-in users to sign in
2. ‚ùå Brand portal not loading (missing database tables)
3. ‚ùå User/Brand toggle not working properly  
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Stripe not tested
5. ‚ùå Email system not working (no emails sent)

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES

### Fix 1: Comments Authentication (FIXED in code)
**File**: `app/components/CommentsSection.tsx`
**Problem**: Relying on server-side user prop that wasn't reliable
**Solution**: Always use client-side auth check directly

### Fix 2: Brand System Database Tables (NEEDS SQL)
**Problem**: Brand dashboard queries tables that don't exist
**Required Tables**:
- `brand_preferences`
- `sponsorship_applications`  
- `brand_community_relationships`

**Action**: Run this SQL migration in Supabase

### Fix 3: Email System (NEEDS CONFIGURATION)
**Problem**: No email service configured
**Required**:
- Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
- Verify domain in Resend dashboard

### Fix 4: Stripe (NEEDS TESTING)
**Problem**: Not tested
**Required**:
- Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are set
- Test payment flow

## üìã SQL TO RUN IN SUPABASE

Run these in order in your Supabase SQL Editor:

### Step 1: Create Brand System Tables

```sql
-- Run this first: sql-migrations/create-brand-system.sql
-- Then: sql-migrations/enable-realtime.sql
```

### Step 2: Enable RLS on New Tables

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE brand_preferences ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE brand_community_relationships ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policies
CREATE POLICY "Brands can read own preferences" ON brand_preferences
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = brand_id);

CREATE POLICY "Brands can update own preferences" ON brand_preferences
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = brand_id);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view brand relationships" ON brand_community_relationships
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
