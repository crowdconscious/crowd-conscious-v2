## 🔍 **Issue #1: Stripe Webhook Improvements**

### **What Was Fixed:**

**File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**

1. ✅ Added comprehensive logging for all webhook events
2. ✅ Added environment variable verification logging
3. ✅ Added detailed error logging with error codes and hints
4. ✅ Added request body and signature validation logging
5. ✅ Added success confirmations for each step

### **What You'll See Now:**

```
🔔 Stripe webhook received
🔍 Environment check: { hasWebhookSecret: true, hasStripeKey: true, ... }
📦 Request details: { bodyLength: 1234, hasSignature: true, ... }
🔐 Verifying webhook signature...

```

### **Testing the Webhook:**

#### **Local Testing with Stripe CLI:**

```bash
# 1. Install Stripe CLI if you haven't
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# 2. Login to Stripe
stripe login

# 3. Forward webhooks to your local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# 4. In another terminal, trigger a test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

#### **Production Testing:**

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add webhook endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events to listen to:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret
5. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

## 🔍 **Issue #2: ShareButton Hardcoded URL**

### **What Was Fixed:**

**File:** `app/components/ShareButton.tsx`

**Problem:**

- ShareButton had hardcoded production URL: `https://crowd-conscious-platform-rasv09idr.vercel.app`
- This caused sharing links to break when deployed to different URLs

**Solution:**

- Now uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or falls back to `window.location.origin`
- Works in all environments (dev, staging, production)

**Before:**

```typescript
const baseUrl = "https://crowd-conscious-platform-rasv09idr.vercel.app";
```

**After:**

```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || window.location.origin;
```

### **Environment Variable Setup:**

Add to your environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.vercel.app
```

## 🔍 **Issue #3: Login/Signup Blocking Issue**

### **Root Cause Analysis:**

The blocking issue was likely caused by:

1. **Race condition**: Client-side `router.push()` was called before the session cookie was fully set
2. **Server-side check timing**: `getCurrentUser()` in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` was checking for the user before the session was properly synchronized
3. **Client routing**: Next.js client-side routing wasn't forcing a server round-trip

### **What Was Fixed:**

#### **A. Login Page** (`app/(public)/login/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**

1. ✅ Added detailed console logging for debugging
2. ✅ Changed from `router.push()` to `window.location.href` for hard navigation
3. ✅ Added error handling for navigation failures
4. ✅ Added session verification logging

**Why `window.location.href` fixes it:**

- Forces a full page reload
- Ensures server sees the updated session cookie
- Prevents race conditions with client-side routing
- Makes `getCurrentUser()` in the layout work correctly

#### **B. Signup Page** (`app/(public)/signup/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**

1. ✅ Enhanced console logging for signup process
2. ✅ Added session state logging
3. ✅ Better error message handling

#### **C. App Layout** (`app/(app)/layout.tsx`)

**Changes:**

1. ✅ Added authentication check logging
2. ✅ Logs when user is found or redirected
3. ✅ Helps debug redirect loops

#### **D. Auth Callback** (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)

**Changes:**

1. ✅ Comprehensive logging for callback flow
2. ✅ Detailed error logging with stack traces
3. ✅ Logs session exchange process

   🚀 Starting signup process...
   📧 Email: test@example.com
   👤 Full name: Test User
   🔗 Redirect URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   📦 Signup response: { hasUser: true, hasSession: true, hasError: false }
   ✅ User created in auth.users: xxx-xxx-xxx
   ```
5. Check your email for confirmation link
6. Click the link
7. **Expected:**
   - Redirect to `/dashboard`
   - User should see their dashboard

### **Test Scenario 2: Sign In Existing User**

   ```
5. **Expected:**
   - Hard navigation to `/dashboard`
   - Page reloads

2. **Expected Console Output (Server-side):**
   ```
   🔄 Auth callback triggered
   📝 Callback params: { hasCode: true, codePreview: '...' }
   🔐 Exchanging code for session...
   📦 Exchange result: { hasUser: true, hasSession: true, hasError: false }
   ✅ Session exchanged successfully, user: xxx-xxx-xxx
   🔄 Redirecting to dashboard...
   ```
3. **Expected:**
   - Redirect to `/dashboard`
   - User authenticated

### **Test Scenario 4: Protected Route Access**

1. Open browser in incognito mode
2. Try to access `/dashboard` directly
3. **Expected Console Output (Server-side):**
   ```
   🔍 AppLayout: Checking user authentication...
   ❌ AppLayout: No user found, redirecting to login
   ```
4. **Expected:**

## 🚀 **Deployment Checklist**

### **Environment Variables Required:**

#### **Vercel/Production:**

```bash
# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# App URL (for sharing and redirects)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app

# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

### **Stripe Dashboard Setup:**

1. ✅ Add webhook endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. ✅ Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
3. ✅ Copy webhook signing secret → Add to Vercel env vars
4. ✅ Ensure Stripe API keys are production keys (start with `sk_live_`)

### **Vercel Deployment:**

1. Push changes to your repository
2. Vercel will auto-deploy
3. Check deployment logs for any errors
4. Test authentication flow in production
5. Test Stripe webhook with test payment

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

### **If Login Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check browser console for errors:**
   - Look for "Sign in process" logs
   - Check for any JavaScript errors
   - Verify session is established

2. **Check server logs (Vercel):**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Logs
   - Look for "AppLayout: Checking user authentication"
   - Check for any auth errors

3. **Clear browser data:**

   ```
   - Clear cookies for your domain
   - Clear localStorage
   - Try in incognito mode
   ```

4. **Verify Supabase configuration:**
   - Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Site URL should match your domain
   - Redirect URLs should include:
     - `https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback`
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for local dev)

### **If Stripe Webhook Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Go to Developers → Webhooks
   - Click on your webhook endpoint
   - Check "Recent deliveries" for errors

2. **Verify webhook secret:**
   - Should start with `whsec_`
   - Must match between Stripe and your env vars

3. **Check server logs:**
   - Look for "Stripe webhook received" logs
   - Check for signature verification errors
