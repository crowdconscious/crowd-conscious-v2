5. ⚠️ No community-created modules yet (Phase 2)
6. ⚠️ Notification toggles are UI-only (not functional)
7. ⚠️ Export buttons are UI-only (not functional)

## 🎯 **Critical Paths to NOT Break**

### User Flows That MUST Work

1. **Employee Onboarding**:
   - Admin invites → Email sent → Accept invitation → Auto-login → See dashboard → Take lessons → Complete module → Get certificate

2. **Corporate Admin Management**:
   - Login → See dashboard → View progress → Check impact → Manage settings → Invite employees

3. **Regular User Access**:
   - Login → See dashboard with corporate banner → Click "Corporate Training" → Route to correct portal

4. **Smart Navigation**:
   - All "Corporate Training" links must route based on user role

5. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Complete lesson → XP awarded → Progress updated → Responses stored → Admin can view
