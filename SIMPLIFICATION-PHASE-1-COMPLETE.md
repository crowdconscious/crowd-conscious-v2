## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (What You Need To Do Now)

### 1. Run Database Migration (5 minutes)

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- Copy and paste from:
sql-migrations/simplify-remove-brand-type.sql
```

This will:
- ✅ Add sponsor fields to sponsorships table
- ✅ Remove brand fields from profiles
- ✅ Create trusted_brands view
- ✅ Set up auto-refresh triggers

### 2. Wait for Vercel Deployment (~2 minutes)

The code is pushing to GitHub now. Vercel will auto-deploy.

### 3. Verify Changes

After deployment:
- ✅ Header should show no brand toggle
- ✅ Navigation simplified
- ✅ No broken links to brand portal
- ✅ Profile pages still work

---

## 📋 Migration Checklist

- [ ] Run SQL migration in Supabase
- [ ] Verify migration success (check for errors)
- [ ] Wait for Vercel deployment
- [ ] Test header navigation
- [ ] Test user profile
- [ ] Verify no brand portal links

---

## 🎯 What This Achieves

### Before (Confusing):
- Two user types: User and Brand
- Toggle between modes
- Separate brand portal
- Brand-specific profile fields
- Confusion about what to choose

### After (Simple):
- One user type: User (or Admin)
- No mode switching
- Single unified flow
- Sponsor as individual OR business per-transaction
- Clear and straightforward

---

## 💡 Key Improvements

1. **Simpler Onboarding**: No need to choose user type upfront
2. **Flexible Sponsoring**: Decide individual vs business each time
3. **Better Data Model**: Sponsor details with each sponsorship
4. **Auto Brand Recognition**: Trusted brands auto-populate landing page
5. **Less Code**: Removed entire brand portal
6. **Fewer Bugs**: Less complexity = fewer edge cases

## 🔄 What Happens to Existing Brand Users?

- Automatically converted to regular users
- Past sponsorships are preserved
- Can still sponsor as business going forward
- Just fill in business details when sponsoring
- No data loss!

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "trusted_brands view doesn't exist"
**Solution**: Run the SQL migration in Supabase

### Issue: "Column sponsor_type doesn't exist"
**Solution**: Run the SQL migration in Supabase

### Issue: "Old brand users can't login"
**Solution**: They'll login fine - migration converts them to users

### Issue: "Brand logos don't show"
**Solution**: Need to implement sponsorship checkout (Phase 2)

## 📝 Notes for Phase 2

When implementing the sponsorship checkout:

   If Business selected:
   - Company Name (required)
